A simple Interactive 15 Square Puzzle built on vanilla JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015).

If you just cloned the folder, all the necessary files should already be built and you can simply open the app via index.html in your browser.

If preferable, you can also run 'node server.js' to run the app on a local server. Default port is 8080.
-If you go this route, you should use a Node version of 6.x or higher, as the app is written in ES6 and won't work properly on old versions of Node.

In the event of any problems, or if any changes are made to the JS (js/main.js) or styles (css/main.less):
-Run `npm install`
-Run `gulp build` (see gulpfile.js for full list of commands).
